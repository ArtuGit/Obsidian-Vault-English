# Change: Add comprehensive Articles content plan

## Why
The current `content/Articles.md` page is only a stub that links to a single subpage, so learners don’t have a coherent, complete path for mastering English article usage.

This change proposes a structured, non-short set of Articles pages that cover the full topic space (a/an, the, zero article, countability, generic reference, proper nouns, common patterns, and high-frequency error correction), aligned to the existing vault’s “learning notes” style.

## What Changes
- Create a content plan for an Articles hub page plus a set of substantial subpages (not short articles).
- Integrate the existing subpage `When Are Countable Nouns Used Without “A” or “An” in English?` into the overall Articles structure.
- Define a consistent page template (examples → rules → contrast → exercises → summary) to keep the series cohesive.

## Proposed Information Architecture
### Hub page
- **Articles (hub)**
  - Purpose: navigation + quick orientation + suggested learning order
  - Includes: a concept map, common decision flow, and links to subpages

### Subpages (planned)
Each subpage is intended to be a *full lesson note* (roughly 900–1800 words of explanation + examples + exercises), not a short overview.

1. **Articles: Core meaning and reference**
   - What articles signal (specific vs non-specific, known vs new, generic)
   - “Reference types” as the organizing principle (definite/indefinite/generic)
   - Minimal terminology, lots of examples

2. **Indefinite article (a/an): choosing and using it**
   - First mention, one-of-many, classification (“She’s a doctor”)
   - Sound-based a/an, tricky cases (hour, university, MBA)
   - Common learner traps and corrections

3. **Definite article (the): when it becomes ‘shared’**
   - Second mention and shared context
   - Unique reference (the sun), superlatives/ordinals
   - “Restricting modifiers” (the + of-phrases, relative clauses)

4. **Zero article: when no article is correct**
   - Plural generic (Dogs are loyal.)
   - Uncountable generic (Water is essential.)
   - Meals, days, languages, most place names (with exceptions)

5. **Countability and articles: count vs non-count choices**
   - Countable vs uncountable meaning shifts (chicken / a chicken)
   - Partitives (a piece of…, a bit of…)
   - The existing page on “countable nouns without a/an” nests here

6. **Generic reference: ‘a lion’ vs ‘the lion’ vs ‘lions’**
   - Comparing the three generic patterns
   - Register and frequency notes
   - Exercises: rewrite sentences in different generic forms

7. **Proper nouns and place names: the rules + the exceptions that matter**
   - Countries, rivers, oceans/seas, mountains (single peaks vs ranges), deserts
   - Airports and transport hubs (e.g., Heathrow Airport, Gatwick; at Heathrow vs at the airport)
   - Buildings/institutions, newspapers/hotels
   - “The Netherlands / Ø France” type contrasts

8. **Institutions and routines: school, hospital, work, home**
   - Go to school / go to the school
   - In hospital (BrE) vs in the hospital (AmE)
   - Meaning changes (institutional vs physical place)

9. **Modifiers that force (or block) articles**
   - Superlatives/ordinals (the best, the first)
   - “Only/last/next” patterns
   - Adjective + noun specificity and “the + adjective” (the rich)

10. **Quantifier expressions that look like articles**
   - a few / few; a little / little
   - such a, quite a, what a
   - Common mistakes and minimal pairs

11. **Measurement, frequency, and ‘per’ expressions**
   - twice a week, $10 a kilo, 60 miles an hour
   - by + unit vs a/an + unit

12. **Articles in headlines, notes, and titles (omission patterns)**
   - Why headlines drop articles
   - When you should NOT imitate headline style

13. **Typical error patterns and diagnostics (B1→C1)**
   - Overuse of “the”
   - Missing “a/an” with singular count nouns
   - Confusion with generic/plural/uncountable
   - A diagnostic checklist and targeted practice sets

14. **Practice pack: mixed exercises + answer keys**
   - Short diagnostic
   - Themed drills (definite/indefinite/zero)
   - Editing task (proofread a paragraph)

## Quality Bar (Non-short Pages)
- Each page should include:
  - A clear “When to use” section
  - A contrast table (“Correct vs common wrong”)
  - 20–40 example sentences across the page
  - At least 8–15 exercises + answer key
  - Cross-links to related pages

## Level + Variety Policy
- **All levels in each page**: Each subpage should include a B1/B2 core, plus clearly marked C1 expansions (e.g., “C1+ Notes”).
- **British default + American variant**: Use British English as the default phrasing and examples, and include an “American version” note for patterns that differ (e.g., in hospital vs in the hospital).

## Impact
- Affects content structure: Articles becomes a hub with multiple subpages.
- No code changes in this proposal stage.

## Open Questions
Resolved:
- Target level coverage: all levels per page (B1/B2 core + C1 expansions).
- Default variety: British English, with an American version where usage differs.
