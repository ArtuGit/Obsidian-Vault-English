# Design: Articles content plan

## Goals
- Provide a complete Articles learning path (hub + subpages) that matches how people actually decide article use.
- Keep pages substantial: explanation, contrasts, and practice with answer keys.
- Make cross-linking intentional so learners can navigate by problem type (e.g., “place names”, “institution vs building”).

## Non-goals
- This change does not implement or modify Quartz code.
- This change does not attempt a full linguistic theory of articles; it prioritizes learnability.

## Organizing principle
The series is organized by **reference type and decision points**:
- Indefinite reference → `a/an`
- Definite reference → `the`
- Generic reference → `Ø` or sometimes `the`/`a` depending on pattern

This avoids fragmenting rules into long exception lists and gives learners a reusable mental model.

## Page template (shared)
Each subpage should follow a consistent structure:
1. **Core idea** (2–5 bullets)
2. **Rules & patterns** (grouped by meaning)
3. **High-frequency exceptions** (only what learners commonly see)
4. **Common errors** (wrong → why → fix)
5. **Practice** (mix of controlled drills + free editing)
6. **Answer key**
7. **Links** (prereqs + next steps)

## Integration of existing page
The existing page `When Are Countable Nouns Used Without “A” or “An” in English?` is treated as a deep-dive that belongs under the broader “Countability and articles” unit.

## Learning order
Suggested default path:
1) Core meaning → 2) a/an → 3) the → 4) zero article → 5) countability → 6) generic reference → then specialized topics.

## Style choices
- Use clear labels: “generic”, “specific”, “first mention”, “shared context”.
- Prefer short rule statements + many examples over dense prose.
- Contrast tables and minimal pairs are required for retention.

## Level + variety approach
- Each page should be usable across levels: a B1/B2 core plus clearly labeled C1 expansions.
- British English is the default; include an “American version” note wherever the most natural phrasing differs.
