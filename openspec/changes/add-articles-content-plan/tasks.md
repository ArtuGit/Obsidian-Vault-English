# Tasks: Add comprehensive Articles content plan

## 1. Proposal validation
- [x] Run `openspec validate add-articles-content-plan --strict` and fix any issues.

## 2. Content structure (implementation after approval)
- [x] Expand `content/Articles.md` into a hub outline that links to all planned subpages.
- [x] Create the new subpage files under `content/` (one file per planned page) using the shared template.
- [x] Integrate the existing page `When Are Countable Nouns Used Without “A” or “An” in English?` into the hub, and add cross-links to/from the new “Countability and articles” page.

## 3. Consistency + quality
- [x] Ensure each subpage meets the non-short quality bar (examples + contrast + exercises + answer keys).
- [x] Add a recommended learning order (B1→B2→C1) on the hub.
- [x] Spot-check internal links resolve correctly in Quartz output.

## 4. Optional validation
- [x] Run the site build (Quartz) to confirm links render and pages are discoverable.
