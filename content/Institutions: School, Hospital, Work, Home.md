Some nouns change meaning depending on whether you use **Ø** (no article) or **the**.

This is very common with “institutions” like school, hospital, university, prison, church, work, and home.

British English is the default in this vault. When American usage differs, see “American version”.

## C1+ Notes

### Institution meaning is about “role”
If the person is there **as the role** (student/patient/prisoner), Ø is likely in BrE.

### Don’t overgeneralise
Not every building works this way. These are specific high-frequency nouns.

## American version
American English often prefers **the** in some institution phrases.

- BrE: He’s **in hospital**.
- AmE: He’s **in the hospital**.

- BrE: She’s **at university**.
- AmE: She’s **in college** / **at college**.

School/work/home patterns are mostly similar, but hospital/university differ the most.
