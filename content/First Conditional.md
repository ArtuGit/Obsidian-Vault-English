## Common Mistakes

❌ **Wrong**: If it **will rain**, I will stay home.  
✅ **Correct**: If it **rains**, I will stay home.

> Never use "will" in the if-clause. Use present simple.

❌ **Wrong**: If you **don't will come**, I'll be sad.  
✅ **Correct**: If you **don't come**, I'll be sad.

> Use "don't/doesn't + base verb" for negatives in the if-clause.

❌ **Wrong**: If she calls me, I **tell** her.  
✅ **Correct**: If she calls me, I **will tell** her.

> Use "will" in the main clause for future result.

## Variations & Notes

### Using Other Modals
You can use other modals instead of "will":

- If you finish early, you **can** leave. (permission)
- If it rains, we **might** cancel the event. (possibility)
- If you want to pass, you **should** study more. (advice)
- If he's late, he **must** call us. (obligation)

### Using "Unless"
"Unless" means "if not":

- **Unless** you hurry, you'll be late. = If you **don't** hurry, you'll be late.
- I won't go **unless** you come with me. = I won't go **if** you **don't** come with me.

### Clause Order
The if-clause can come first or second:

- If you call me, I'll answer.
- I'll answer if you call me.

> Use a comma when the if-clause comes first. No comma when it comes second.
