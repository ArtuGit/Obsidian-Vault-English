## Quick decision guide (B1/B2 core)

Ask these questions in order:

1) **Is it a proper name?**
- Usually **no article**: Ø *London*, Ø *Heathrow*, Ø *Mount Everest*
- But some names need **the**: *the UK*, *the Netherlands*, *the Alps*, *the Pacific*
- Learn the patterns in [[Proper Nouns and Place Names (Articles)]]

2) **Is it a singular countable noun?**
- You normally need a determiner: **a/an**, **the**, **my**, **this**, **each**, etc.
- If you want “one of many / not specific yet” → **a/an**
- If you mean a specific, shared/known one → **the**
- See [[Indefinite Article (a-an)]] and [[Definite Article (the)]]

3) **Are you speaking generically?** (about a whole class)
- Often use **plural / uncountable with zero article**: Ø *Dogs are loyal.* Ø *Water is essential.*
- Sometimes you can use *a/an* or *the* for generic meaning (more advanced)
- See [[Generic Reference with Articles]]

4) **Is it an institution meaning?**
- BrE: *in hospital* (treatment) vs *in the hospital* (the building)
- See [[Institutions: School, Hospital, Work, Home]]

## British default + American version

This series uses **British English** as the default (e.g., *in hospital*). When American usage differs, each page includes an **American version** note.

## If you keep making the same mistake

- Missing **a/an** with singular count nouns → start with [[Indefinite Article (a-an)]]
- Overusing **the** → read [[Definite Article (the)]] + [[Generic Reference with Articles]]
- Confusing place names → read [[Proper Nouns and Place Names (Articles)]]
- “school / the school” confusion → read [[Institutions: School, Hospital, Work, Home]]
