The definite article (**the**) signals that the listener/reader can identify **which one** you mean.

British English is the default in this vault. When American usage differs, see “American version”.

## Core idea (B1/B2)

Use **the** when the noun is **specific + identifiable**.

Identifiable because:
- it was mentioned before,
- it’s obvious from the situation,
- it’s unique,
- it’s restricted/defined by extra information.

## Main uses

### 1) Second mention
- I bought **a** book. **The** book is brilliant.

### 2) Shared situation (in this place / right now)
- Close **the** window.
- Where’s **the** toilet?

### 3) Unique reference
- **the** sun, **the** moon, **the** internet

### 4) Restricting information (makes it definite)
- **the** book **on the table**
- **the** person **who called you**
- **the** end **of the film**

### 5) Superlatives and ordinals
- **the** best day, **the** first time, **the** next step
See [[Modifiers that Force or Block Articles]].

### 6) Some proper-name patterns
- the UK, the Netherlands, the Alps, the Pacific
See [[Proper Nouns and Place Names (Articles)]].
