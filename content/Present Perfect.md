## Practice Tips

1. **Life experience interview:** Ask yourself "Have you ever...?" questions. "Have I ever climbed a mountain? Yes, I have. I've climbed Mount Fuji."

2. **Today's achievements:** At the end of each day, list what you've done. "Today I've sent 20 emails, I've had two meetings, and I've finished a report."

3. **For/Since practice:** Write sentences about duration. "I've had this phone for two years. I've known my best friend since primary school."
