The Past Simple describes completed actions at a specific time in the past. It's the most common tense for talking about finished events, stories, and historical facts. Compare with [[Present Perfect]] when the exact time isn't important or has present relevance.

## Form

### ✅ Positive (Affirmative)

| Subject | Structure | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| All subjects | verb + **-ed** (regular) or irregular form | I **worked** yesterday. / She **went** home. |

**Regular verb spelling rules:**
- Most verbs: add **-ed** → *worked, played, started*
- Verbs ending in -e: add **-d** → *lived, loved, decided*
- Verbs ending in consonant + y: change y to **-ied** → *studied, carried, tried*
- Short verbs (CVC): double final consonant + **-ed** → *stopped, planned, dropped*

**Irregular verbs** must be memorized: *go → went, see → saw, have → had, be → was/were*

### ❌ Negative

| Subject | Structure | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| All subjects | did not (didn't) + base verb | I **didn't see** him. |

**Note:** The verb returns to its base form after *didn't*.

|------|-----------|---------|
| Yes/No | Did + subject + base verb? | **Did** you **call** her? |

**Exception:** When *who/what* is the subject, don't use *did*:

### Short Answers
