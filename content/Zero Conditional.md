# Zero Conditional

The **Zero Conditional** is used to express general truths, scientific facts, and things that are always true when a certain condition is met.

## Structure

**Affirmative**: If you heat ice, it melts.  
**Negative**: If you don't water plants, they die.

## When to Use

### 1. Scientific Facts
Things that are scientifically proven and always happen.

- If you heat water to 100°C, it boils.
- If you freeze water, it becomes ice.
- If you drop something, it falls.

### 2. General Truths
Universal facts that everyone accepts as true.

- If you mix red and blue, you get purple.
- If people don't eat, they get hungry.
- If the sun sets, it gets dark.

### 3. Habits and Routines
Actions that regularly happen as a result of a condition.

- If I wake up late, I skip breakfast.
- If she has free time, she reads a book.
- If it's sunny, we eat outside.

### 4. Instructions and Directions
Giving instructions where the result is automatic or expected.

- If the light turns red, stop.
- If you press this button, the machine starts.
- If you want to save the file, click here.

## Examples

| If clause | Main clause |

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Wrong**: If you heat water, it **will boil**.  
✅ **Correct**: If you heat water, it **boils**.

> Don't use "will" in the Zero Conditional. Use present simple in both clauses.

❌ **Wrong**: If you **will press** this button, the door opens.  
✅ **Correct**: If you **press** this button, the door opens.

> Never use "will" in the if-clause.

## Variations & Notes

### Using "When" instead of "If"
"When" can replace "if" in Zero Conditional sentences with almost the same meaning:

- **When** you heat water, it boils.
- **When** I'm tired, I go to bed early.

### Clause Order
The if-clause can come first or second:

- If you heat ice, it melts.
- Ice melts if you heat it.

> Note: Use a comma when the if-clause comes first. No comma when it comes second.
