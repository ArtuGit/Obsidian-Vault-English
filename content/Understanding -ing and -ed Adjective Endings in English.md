## **-ing Adjectives: Describing What Causes a Feeling**

Adjectives ending in **-ing** describe something that **produces** a feeling or reaction. They are often used for **inanimate objects**, events, or situations that **cause** someone to feel a certain way.

### ✅ Examples (Inanimate Objects):

- The **book** was **fascinating**.
    
- That **film** is **terrifying**.
    
- The **weather** today is **depressing**.
    
- This **song** is so **relaxing**.
    
- His **speech** was **inspiring**.
    

These adjectives **do not describe emotions themselves**, but rather the **source** of those emotions.

> Think of **-ing adjectives** as answering the question:  
> ❓ _"What is it like?"_  
> ✅ "It is **boring**, **exciting**, **confusing**..."

## **-ed Adjectives: Describing Feelings or Reactions**

Adjectives ending in **-ed** usually describe how a **person or animal feels** in response to something. They are rarely used for inanimate objects unless the object is personified or metaphorical.

### ✅ Examples (Usually Not for Inanimate Objects):

- I felt **bored** during the lecture.
    
- She was **excited** about the trip.
    
- He seemed **confused** by the instructions.
    

### 🚫 Avoid using -ed adjectives for inanimate objects:

- ✖ _The book was bored_ → ❌ Incorrect
    
- ✔ _The book was boring_ → ✅ Correct
    

However, in rare poetic or literary contexts, inanimate objects may appear with -ed forms for stylistic effect (e.g., _a weathered stone_), but this is more about physical states or metaphor than emotion.

## ✅ **-ing Adjectives with Inanimate Objects**: Normal and Common

These describe how **things make people feel**. Inanimate objects do **not** feel emotions, but they **can cause** emotions in people, which is why -ing adjectives are correct here.

### 🔹 Examples:

- The **lecture** was **boring**.
    
- That **painting** is **inspiring**.
    
- The **documentary** was **shocking**.
    
- The **machine** is **confusing** to operate.
    
- This **software** is **amazing**.
    

These are all natural uses — the object causes a reaction in someone else.

## 🚫 **-ed Adjectives with Inanimate Objects**: Usually Wrong

Adjectives ending in **-ed** describe a **reaction or feeling**, which only **living beings** (people or animals) can truly have. You should **not** use them with inanimate objects — unless you're using metaphor or describing a **state**, not a **feeling**.

### 🔻 Incorrect Uses:

- ✖ The movie was **bored**.
    
- ✖ This app is **confused**.
    
- ✖ The book felt **amused**.
    

These are incorrect because the object can't **feel** anything.

## ⚠️ When -ed **Can** Be Used for Inanimate Objects

There are **rare but acceptable** situations where -ed adjectives are used with inanimate objects:

### 🔸 1. **Physical states or appearance** (not emotions):

- **weathered** stone = aged and worn by the elements
    
- **cracked** mirror = physically broken
    
- **twisted** metal = bent or deformed
    

These are **not emotional reactions** but **descriptions of condition**.

### 🔸 2. **Poetic or metaphorical language**:

In literature or poetry, writers sometimes **personify** objects:

- _The **tired** old house leaned against the hill._
    
- _A **forgotten** letter lay in the drawer._
    

This adds emotional tone but isn't standard usage in academic or everyday speech.
