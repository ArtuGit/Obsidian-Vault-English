## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct | Explanation |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| I was work when you called. | I **was working** when you called. | Need verb + -ing |
| She were sleeping. | She **was** sleeping. | He/She/It uses *was* |
| What you were doing? | What **were you** doing? | Invert subject and verb |
| I was knowing the answer. | I **knew** the answer. | Stative verbs don't take continuous |
| While I cooked, he called. | While I **was cooking**, he called. | Longer action needs continuous |
| When I was walking, I was seeing him. | When I was walking, I **saw** him. | Short action uses Past Simple |
| I were watching TV. | I **was** watching TV. | I uses *was* |

## When vs. While

| WHEN | WHILE |
|------|-------|
| Usually introduces the **short action** | Usually introduces the **long action** |
| + Past Simple (usually) | + Past Continuous (usually) |
| When the phone **rang**, I was sleeping. | While I **was sleeping**, the phone rang. |
| When she **arrived**, we were eating. | While we **were eating**, she arrived. |

**Both can introduce long actions:**
- When/While I **was walking** home, I saw her.

## Tense Comparison: Past Continuous vs. Past Simple

| Past Continuous | Past Simple |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Action **in progress** | **Completed** action |
| Background / scene setting | Main events in a story |
| **Interrupted** action | **Interrupting** action |
| Emphasizes **duration** | Emphasizes **completion** |

**Examples:**
- I **was watching** TV when she **called**. *(long action interrupted)*
- I **watched** TV and then **went** to bed. *(two completed actions)*
- At 9 PM, I **was studying**. *(in progress at that time)*

| I **was working** at 9 yesterday. | I **am working** now. |
| She **was living** in Paris in 2020. | She **is living** in Paris now. |

| Emotions | She **loved** music. *(not: was loving)* |
| Possession | He **had** a car. *(not: was having, for possession)* |
| Senses | It **smelled** nice. *(not: was smelling)* |

## Passive Voice

The Past Continuous Passive describes actions that were being done at a specific moment in the past.

### Form

| **Negative** | was/were + not + being + past participle | The room **wasn't being used** then. |
| **Question** | Was/Were + subject + being + past participle? | **Was** the project **being discussed**? |

### Examples

**Actions in progress at a past moment:**
- When I arrived, the house **was being painted**.
- The road **was being repaired** all last week.
- At 3 PM, the meeting **was being held** in the main hall.

**Background actions in narratives:**

- The guests **were being served** when the lights went out.

**Interrupted passive actions:**

**Note:** Less common than [[Past Simple]] Passive, but useful when emphasizing that the action was in progress.

## Practice Tips

1. **Describe a photo:** Look at a photo and describe what people were doing. "The man was sitting on a bench. Two children were playing in the park. A dog was running."

2. **"What were you doing when...":** Practice interrupted actions. "What were you doing when the pandemic started? I was working in an office."

3. **Tell a story:** Set the scene using Past Continuous, then add events in Past Simple. "It was raining. I was walking home. Suddenly, I saw my old friend."
