Headlines, labels, and titles often **omit articles** (Ø) to be short and punchy.

This is a style choice, not normal sentence grammar.

British English is the default in this vault. When American usage differs, see “American version”.

## B1/B2 core: what headlines do

### Article omission
- “Man wins lottery” (instead of “A man wins the lottery”)
- “Government announces new plan”

### Other headline features
- Present simple for past events
- Short noun phrases

---

## When NOT to copy headline style
In normal writing/speaking you usually need articles.

Headline:
- “Woman finds cat”

Normal sentence:
- A woman found a cat.

---

## Instructions and labels (similar omission)
- Push button.
- Add egg.

See [[Countability and Articles]] and [[When Are Countable Nouns Used Without “A” or “An” in English?]].
