Proper nouns (names) often take **no article (Ø)**, but there are important patterns where **the** is required.

This page covers the high-frequency categories learners meet: countries, mountains, seas/oceans, rivers, airports, and other place-name patterns.

British English is the default in this vault. When American usage differs, see “American version”.
