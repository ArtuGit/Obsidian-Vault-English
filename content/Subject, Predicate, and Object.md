These are the **basic building blocks** of a sentence. Understanding them helps you form clear, grammatically correct sentences.

## Subject

The **subject** is the person, place, thing, or idea that **performs the action** or is **being described**.  
It answers the question: **"Who?"** or **"What?"** before the verb.

**Examples:**

- **The cat** sleeps on the sofa.
    
- **She** is reading a book.
    
- **Honesty** is the best policy.
    
---
## Predicate

The **predicate** is the part of the sentence that tells **what the subject does** or **what happens to the subject**.  
It always includes a **verb** and often contains other elements such as objects, adverbs, or phrases.

**Examples:**

- The cat **sleeps on the sofa**.
    
- She **is reading a book**.
    
- Honesty **is the best policy**.

## Object

The **object** receives the action of the verb. There are two main types:

### 1. **Direct Object** – Receives the action directly.

**Question answered:** _What?_ or _Whom?_

- She reads **a book**.
    
- He kicked **the ball**.
    
### 2. **Indirect Object** – Tells **to whom** or **for whom** the action is done. Often appears before the direct object.

- She gave **him** a gift.
    
- They sent **me** a letter.
