Some words and structures strongly push you toward **the**, **a/an**, or **Ø**.

This page focuses on the high-frequency “article triggers”: superlatives, ordinals, only/last/next, defining phrases, and the “the + adjective” pattern.

British English is the default in this vault. When American usage differs, see “American version”.

## B1/B2 core triggers

### 1) Superlatives → usually **the**
- the best day
- the most important reason

### 2) Ordinals → usually **the**
- the first time
- the second question
- the next step

### 3) “Only / last / same / right” → often **the**
- the only problem
- the last train
- the same answer
- the right place

### 4) Defining information makes it definite
If you add a defining phrase, **the** often becomes natural:
- the book **on the table**
- the person **who called you**
- the reason **I’m here**
