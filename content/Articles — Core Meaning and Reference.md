Articles help you show what kind of reference you mean:
- **Indefinite**: one of many / not identified yet → **a/an**
- **Definite**: specific and identifiable to the listener/reader → **the**
- **Zero article (Ø)**: no article (common with plurals, uncountables, many proper names)

British English is the default in this vault. When American usage differs, see “American version”.

## The three reference types (B1/B2 core)

### 1) Indefinite (a/an)
Use **a/an** when the listener doesn’t know which one you mean (or it doesn’t matter).

- I bought **a** book yesterday. *(one book, not identified yet)*
- She’s **an** engineer. *(classification)*

### 2) Definite (the)
Use **the** when the listener can identify which one you mean.

- I bought **a** book yesterday. **The** book is great. *(second mention)*
- Can you open **the** window? *(the one in this room)*

### 3) Zero article (Ø)
Use **no article** in many general statements.

- Ø Dogs are loyal. *(plural generic)*
- Ø Water is essential. *(uncountable generic)*

## A simple decision flow

Ask:

1) **Is it a proper name?**
- Often Ø: Ø London, Ø Heathrow, Ø Mount Everest
- Sometimes **the**: the UK, the Netherlands, the Alps, the Pacific
- See [[Proper Nouns and Place Names (Articles)]]

2) **Is it a singular countable noun?**
- If yes, you usually need a determiner: **a/an**, **the**, **my**, **this**, **each**, etc.

3) **Is it specific/identifiable for the listener?**
- If yes → **the**
- If no → **a/an**

4) **Are you talking in general (generic)?**
- Often plural/uncountable with Ø
- See [[Generic Reference with Articles]]

## Key ideas with examples

### First mention vs second mention
- I saw **a** dog. **The** dog was very friendly.

### “Shared context” (situational)
Even if it’s the first time you mention it, it can be definite because the situation makes it obvious.
- Close **the** door. *(the door of this room)*
- Where’s **the** bathroom? *(the bathroom in this home/restaurant)*

### Unique things
- **the** sun, **the** internet, **the** President *(in a specific country/context)*

### Generic statements
- Ø Cars are expensive. *(cars in general)*
- Ø Life is short.

## C1+ Notes

### “Bridging” (inferable definiteness)
Sometimes **the** is possible even on first mention because it’s logically connected.
- I walked into a house. **The** kitchen was huge. *(a house implies a kitchen)*

### “Restricting information” makes something definite
- I spoke to **the** woman **who works here**.

## American version
Mostly the same. The biggest differences are in institution phrases (see [[Institutions: School, Hospital, Work, Home]]):
- BrE: She’s **in hospital**.
- AmE: She’s **in the hospital**.
