English expresses “who/what something belongs to” in a few main ways:

- **Possessive determiners** before a noun: *my book, her idea*
- **Possessive pronouns** (no noun after): *This is mine.*
- **’s (genitive)** on a noun/name: *John’s car, the company’s policy*
- **of-phrases**: *the door of the car* (often for things/abstracts)
- **Noun + noun** (compound nouns): *chicken soup, school uniform*

[[Personal Pronouns]] and [[Parts of Speech]] are helpful background for this topic.

## 1) Possessive determiners (before a noun)

These behave like determiners (similar “slot” to articles):

| Person | Determiner | Example |
|---|---|---|
| I | my | *my phone* |
| you | your | *your plan* |
| he | his | *his jacket* |
| she | her | *her answer* |
| it | its | *its color* |
| we | our | *our teacher* |
| they | their | *their house* |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You normally do **not** use an article with a possessive determiner: ~~*the my book*~~ → *my book*.
> See [[Articles]] for article rules.

### “its” vs “it’s”

> [!WARNING]
> **its** = possessive (*The dog wagged its tail.*)
> **it’s** = *it is* / *it has* (*It’s raining.* / *It’s been great.*)

---

## 2) Possessive pronouns (stand alone)

These replace *possessive determiner + noun*:

| Person | Pronoun | Example |
|---|---|---|
| I | mine | *This is mine.* |
| you | yours | *Is this yours?* |
| he | his | *That seat is his.* |
| she | hers | *The bag is hers.* |
| it | (rare) | Usually avoid: prefer *its + noun* |
| we | ours | *The responsibility is ours.* |
| they | theirs | *The choice is theirs.* |

> [!NOTE]
> *His* can be a determiner (*his car*) or a pronoun (*The car is his*). Context shows which.

## 3) Noun + ’s (the genitive)

### Basic form

- Singular noun: **noun + ’s** → *my friend’s laptop*
- Plural ending in -s: **noun + ’** → *my parents’ house*
- Irregular plural (not ending in -s): **noun + ’s** → *children’s toys*

> [!TIP]
> Use **’s** most naturally for people/animals, organizations, time, and “personal” relationships:
> - *Sara’s opinion* (person)
> - *the cat’s paws* (animal)
> - *the company’s results* (organization)
> - *today’s meeting* (time)

### Names ending in -s

Both occur in real usage:

- *James’s book* (common in many style guides)
- *James’ book* (also accepted in some contexts)

For learning consistency, prefer **add ’s** unless you’re following a specific style guide.

### Possession vs description

’s can express more than ownership:

- *the doctor’s office* (the office where a doctor works)
- *women’s health* (topic/category)
- *a day’s work* (measure)

---

## 4) The “of” structure

**the + noun + of + noun** is common when the “owner” is a thing, a long phrase, or something abstract:

- *the handle of the door*
- *the beginning of the story*
- *the results of the experiment*

> [!NOTE]
> Sometimes both are possible but feel different:
> - *the car’s door* (possible, but often less natural)
> - *the door of the car* (more natural)

---

## 5) Noun + noun (compound nouns)

This is not “possession” grammatically; it’s a very common way to describe what something is for / made of / related to:

- *coffee cup* (a cup for coffee)
- *chicken soup* (soup made with chicken)
- *student card* (a card for students)

> [!TIP]
> When you’re deciding between **noun+noun** and **’s**, ask:
> - Is it a **type/category**? → *noun+noun*
> - Is it a **specific person/owner/relationship**? → *’s*

---

## 6) “Whose” for questions and relative clauses

- Question: *Whose book is this?*
- Relative clause: *I met a person whose English is excellent.*

---

## 7) Common learner errors

> [!CAUTION]
> 1) **its / it’s** confusion (see above)
> 2) Article + possessive: ~~*the my friend*~~ → *my friend*
> 3) Wrong plural apostrophe: ~~*childrens’*~~ → *children’s*
> 4) Overusing ’s with things: prefer **of** for many objects/abstract ideas

---

## Quick practice

Convert the meaning using a different possessive form:

1) *the bike of my brother* → (’s)
2) *This is my seat.* → (possessive pronoun)
3) *the toys of the children* → (’s)
4) *the end of the lesson* → (optional: try ’s and compare naturalness)
