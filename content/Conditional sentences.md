A **conditional sentence** expresses a relationship between a condition and its outcome. These sentences allow us to discuss possibilities, hypotheticals, and cause-and-effect relationships.

## Structure

Every conditional sentence has two parts:

| Part | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **If-clause** (protasis) | States the condition | *If you study hard* |
| **Main clause** (apodosis) | States the result | *you will pass the exam* |

The clauses can appear in either order:

- *If you call me, I'll come.* (if-clause first)
- *I'll come if you call me.* (main clause first — no comma needed)

## Beyond "If"

Other words and phrases can introduce conditions:

| Word/Phrase | Usage | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| **unless** | "if not" | *Unless you hurry, we'll be late.* |
| **provided (that)** | formal condition | *You can go, provided that you finish your work.* |
| **as long as** | condition with emphasis | *I'll help you as long as you listen.* |
| **in case** | precaution | *Take an umbrella in case it rains.* |
| **suppose / supposing** | hypothetical | *Suppose you won the lottery, what would you do?* |

## Inverted Conditionals

In formal or literary English, conditionals can drop "if" and use inversion:

- *Had I known* (= If I had known), I would have helped.
- *Were she here* (= If she were here), she would agree.
- *Should you need assistance* (= If you should need), please ask.
