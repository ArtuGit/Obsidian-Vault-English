The Present Continuous (also called Present Progressive) describes actions happening right now, temporary situations, and future arrangements. It emphasizes that something is in progress. Compare with [[Present Simple]] for habits and permanent states.

## Stative Verbs (Cannot Use Continuous)

These verbs describe states, not actions, and typically don't take -ing:

| Category          | Verbs                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mental states** | know, believe, understand, remember, forget, think (opinion), suppose |
| **Emotions**      | love, hate, like, prefer, want, need, wish                            |
| **Senses**        | see, hear, smell, taste, feel *(when involuntary)*                    |
| **Possession**    | have, own, belong, possess                                            |
| **Other**         | be, seem, appear, mean, cost, contain, consist                        |

- I **have** a car. *(possession)* → I **am having** lunch. *(eating)*
- This soup **tastes** good. *(quality)* → I **am tasting** the soup. *(action)*
