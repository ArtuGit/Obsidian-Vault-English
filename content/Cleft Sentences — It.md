It-clefts are a way to **highlight (focus) one part** of a sentence for emphasis, contrast, or correction.

---

## What an it-cleft does

An it-cleft splits one sentence into two parts:

- **Main clause:** *It + be* …
- **Cleft clause:** a clause introduced by **that / who / which** (or sometimes zero in informal speech)

The meaning is usually the same as the “normal” sentence, but the **information focus** changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Clefts are about **focus and contrast**, not “more formal grammar”. If there’s nothing to highlight, a normal sentence is usually better.

## Core pattern

**Pattern**

**It + be + FOCUS + (that/who/which) + rest of the clause**

### Examples (with the focused part)

- It was **John** who called. *(focus = subject)*
- It was **John** that I called. *(focus = object)*
- It was **yesterday** that I called John. *(focus = time)*
- It’s **at this point** that many learners get confused. *(focus = place/point)*
- It was **because I was tired** that I left early. *(focus = reason clause)*

Compare:

- Normal: John called.
- Cleft: It was **John** who called. *(= not Mary)*

> [!TIP]
> Quick test: ask “**What exactly is the speaker correcting/contrasting?**” That’s usually the focused part.

## What you can focus (and what you usually can’t)

You can focus many sentence parts (constituents):

- a **noun phrase**: *It was **my teacher** that helped me.*
- a **prepositional phrase**: *It was **in 2020** that we moved.*
- an **adverbial/time phrase**: *It’s **today** that matters.*
- a **because/when/where** type phrase: *It was **because the bus was late** that I missed it.*

> [!WARNING]
> It-clefts are usually **not** used to focus the main verb/action itself.
> - If you want to focus an action, English often uses a **what-cleft** (pseudo-cleft): *What I **did** was apologize.* (see [[Cleft Sentences — What]])

---

## Tense and agreement

The verb **be** in the it-cleft carries tense:

- Present: *It **is** John who calls every day.*
- Past: *It **was** John who called yesterday.*
- Perfect: *It **has been** John who has supported me.* (less common, but possible)

The cleft clause keeps the tense that matches the situation:

- It **was** John who **called**.
- It **is** John who **is calling**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don’t force the cleft clause tense to match “be”. Choose the tense you would use in the normal sentence.

---

## Choosing “that / who / which”

- **who**: common for people in careful writing
- **which**: for things (less common in it-clefts)
- **that**: works for people and things, especially in speech

Examples:

- It was my brother **who/that** broke it.
- It was the key **that** opened the door.

> [!NOTE]
> In informal spoken English, you’ll often hear: *It’s John Ø I told you about.* (relative pronoun omitted). In writing, keep **that/who**.

---

## Common meanings (why speakers use it-clefts)

### 1) Correction

- It wasn’t **Monday** that she called — it was **Tuesday**.

### 2) Contrast

- It’s **the ending** that I dislike, not the beginning.

### 3) Making the focus explicit

- It’s **your explanation** that helped me understand. *(signals what matters)*

This is closely related to information structure and [[Word Order]].

## Negation and questions

### Negation

- It **wasn’t** John who called.
- It’s **not** because I’m lazy that I’m late.

### Questions

- **Was it** John who called?
- **Is it** today that we need to decide?

Short answers:

- Yes, **it was**.
- No, **it wasn’t**.

## Typical learner mistakes

> [!CAUTION]
> 1) **Double subject/object**
> - ❌ *It was John he called.*
> - ✅ *It was John that he called.*
>
> 2) **Wrong focus** (cleft used without contrast)
> - Overusing clefts can sound heavy or unnatural.
>
> 3) **Wrong relative word**
> - Prefer *who* for people in formal writing; *that* is fine in speech.

## Practice (rewrite with focus)

Rewrite each sentence using an it-cleft to focus the bold part.

1) **Maria** solved the problem.
2) I met him **at the station**.
3) We moved here **in 2019**.
4) I left early **because I felt sick**.
5) I need **your advice**, not your sympathy.

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer key (one possible set)**
> 1) It was **Maria** who solved the problem.
> 2) It was **at the station** that I met him.
> 3) It was **in 2019** that we moved here.
> 4) It was **because I felt sick** that I left early.
> 5) It’s **your advice** that I need, not your sympathy.
