## Form

|---------|-----------|---------|
| I / You / We / They | base verb | I **work** from home. |
| He / She / It | base verb + **-s/-es** | She **works** at a bank. |

**Spelling rules for 3rd person singular:**
- Most verbs: add **-s** → *works, plays, reads*
- Verbs ending in -s, -sh, -ch, -x, -o: add **-es** → *watches, goes, fixes*
- Verbs ending in consonant + y: change y to **-ies** → *studies, carries*

|---------|-----------|---------|
| I / You / We / They | do not (don't) + base verb | I **don't like** coffee. |
| He / She / It | does not (doesn't) + base verb | He **doesn't speak** French. |

### ❓ Questions

| Yes/No | Do/Does + subject + base verb? | **Do** you **play** tennis? |
| Wh- | Wh-word + do/does + subject + base verb? | **Where does** she **live**? |

**Note:** When *who/what* is the subject, don't use *do/does*:

## Practice Tips

1. **Daily routine exercise:** Describe your typical day using Present Simple. "I wake up at 7. I have breakfast. I go to work..."

2. **Facts about yourself:** Write 10 true sentences about your habits, preferences, and life. "I like music. I don't eat meat. I work from home."

3. **Third person practice:** Describe someone else's routine. This forces you to remember the -s/-es rule. "My friend works at Google. She starts at 9..."
