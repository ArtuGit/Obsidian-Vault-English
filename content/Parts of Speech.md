In English, there are **eight main parts of speech**. Each plays a specific role in a sentence. Here's a quick overview:

## Noun

A **noun** names a person, place, thing, or idea. It serves as the subject or object in a sentence. Nouns answer the questions _Who?_ and _What?_ For example, in the sentence "The **cat** sleeps on the **sofa**," both "cat" and "sofa" are nouns.

## Pronoun

A **pronoun** replaces a noun to avoid repetition and simplify language. It helps refer back to something previously mentioned or clearly understood. Pronouns answer questions like _Who?_ or _Which one?_ Examples include "he," "they," "this," and "who."

## Verb

A **verb** expresses an action, an occurrence, or a state of being. Verbs are essential to sentence structure and form the predicate. They answer questions such as _What is happening?_ or _What is the subject doing?_ In "She **runs** every morning," the verb is "runs."

## Adjective

An **adjective** describes or modifies a noun or pronoun. It gives more detail by answering questions like _What kind?_ _How many?_ or _Which one?_ In "The **red** balloon floated away," "red" is the adjective modifying "balloon."

## Adverb

An **adverb** modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb. It provides information about how, when, where, or to what extent something happens. Adverbs answer questions such as _How?_ _When?_ _Where?_ and _To what extent?_ For example, "She sings **beautifully**" uses "beautifully" as an adverb modifying "sings."

## Preposition

A **preposition** shows the relationship between a noun (or pronoun) and another word in the sentence. It often indicates direction, location, time, or method. Prepositions answer questions like _Where?_ _When?_ or _In what way?_ In "The book is **on** the table," "on" is the preposition showing the relationship between "book" and "table."

## Conjunction

A **conjunction** connects words, phrases, or clauses and helps show relationships such as addition, contrast, or cause. Conjunctions answer the question _What connects with what?_ In "I wanted to go, **but** I was tired," the word "but" connects two clauses and shows contrast.

## Interjection

An **interjection** expresses emotion, surprise, or a sudden feeling. It often stands alone and is followed by an exclamation point or comma. Interjections answer the question _What emotion is being expressed?_ Words like "Wow!" "Oh," and "Oops!" are common examples.
