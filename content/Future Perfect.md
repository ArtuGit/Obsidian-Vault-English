## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct | Explanation |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| I will have finish by 5. | I **will have finished** by 5. | Need past participle |
| By 6, I will finished. | By 6, I **will have finished**. | Need *will have* |
| She will has completed it. | She **will have** completed it. | Always *will have*, not *will has* |
| By next year, I will work here for 10 years. | By next year, I **will have worked** here for 10 years. | Duration to future point needs Future Perfect |
| I will have went home. | I **will have gone** home. | *Gone* is the past participle |
| When will you have finish? | **When will** you **have finished**? | Past participle needed |

## By vs. Until/By the time

| Expression | Meaning | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **By** + time | at or before that time | By 5 PM, I **will have finished**. |
| **By the time** + clause | at the moment when | By the time you arrive, I **will have left**. |
| **Until** | up to that time (continuous) | I **will work** until 5 PM. *(not Future Perfect)* |

**Note:** "Until" doesn't typically use Future Perfect—it focuses on the duration, not completion:
- I'll work **until** 5 PM. *(continuing until that time)*
- **By** 5 PM, I'll have finished. *(completed before that time)*
