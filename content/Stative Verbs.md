Stative verbs describe **states** (conditions, feelings, opinions, possession), not actions. They often avoid the **continuous** forms.

## What “stative” means

Stative verbs typically answer “What is the situation?” rather than “What is happening?”

- **Action/dynamic**: *I’m running.* (an activity in progress)
- **State/stative**: *I know the answer.* (a mental state)

>[!NOTE]
Many stative verbs are most natural in the **Present Simple** because they describe facts, habits, and stable conditions.

## Common groups of stative verbs

### Thoughts and opinions

Common verbs: **know, believe, think (opinion), understand, remember, forget, mean, agree, doubt**

- *I believe you.*
- *She understands the rule.*

### Feelings and preferences

Common verbs: **like, love, hate, prefer, want, need, mind**

- *We prefer tea.*
- *I need help.*

### Senses (perception)

Common verbs: **see, hear, smell, taste, feel**

- *This smells great.*
- *I hear a noise.*

### Possession and relationship

Common verbs: **have (possess), own, belong (to), contain, include, consist (of)**

- *She has a car.*
- *This box contains tools.*

### Being, seeming, and measurement

Common verbs: **be, seem, appear, exist, depend (on), matter, weigh, cost**

- *It depends on the weather.*
- *The ticket costs $20.*

[!IMPORTANT]
Lists help, but the real key is meaning: some verbs can be stative OR dynamic depending on what you mean.

## Stative vs dynamic: same verb, different meaning

These are the most useful “exceptions” to learn.

### think

- **Opinion (stative):** *I think it’s a good idea.*
- **Mental process (dynamic):** *I’m thinking about your question.*

### have

- **Possession (stative):** *She has two brothers.*
- **Activity/experience (dynamic):** *We’re having lunch.* / *They’re having a great time.*

### see

- **Perception (stative):** *I see the problem now.*
- **Meeting/relationship (dynamic):** *I’m seeing my dentist tomorrow.* / *She’s seeing someone.*

### taste / smell / feel

- **State (stative):** *The soup tastes salty.*
- **Action (dynamic):** *The chef is tasting the soup.*

### be

- **Identity/state (usually stative):** *He’s polite.*
- **Temporary behaviour (dynamic, informal):** *He’s being polite today.*

>[!TIP]
If you can replace the verb with “**right now, in progress**” and it still makes sense, it’s probably being used dynamically.

## Present Simple vs Present Continuous with stative meaning

### Usually Present Simple

- *I know.* (not: *I’m knowing*)
- *She wants to go.* (not: *She’s wanting* in most standard contexts)
- *This belongs to me.*

### Sometimes Present Continuous (dynamic meaning)

- *I’m having a shower.* (activity)
- *She’s thinking about moving abroad.* (process)
- *We’re tasting different cheeses.* (action)

>[!WARNING]
Some “stative in Simple / dynamic in Continuous” uses are **more common in spoken English** and can sound unusual in formal writing.

## Quick check: is this verb stative here?

Ask:

1. Is it a **state** (a condition/opinion/possession) rather than an action?
2. Is it **not intentionally controlled** or “in progress”?
3. Would the continuous form sound odd?

If the answer is mostly “yes”, use **Present Simple**.

## Common learner mistakes

- *I’m knowing* → **I know**
- *She’s having two sisters* (possession) → **She has two sisters**
- *I’m understanding* → **I understand** (unless you mean “I’m starting to understand” in a specific context)

>[!CAUTION]
Don’t treat “stative verbs” as a fixed list. Many verbs change category depending on meaning.

## Practice

Choose the best option (Simple or Continuous).

1) I (think / am thinking) this is the best solution.
2) Be quiet — I (hear / am hearing) something.
3) We (have / are having) dinner right now.
4) This perfume (smells / is smelling) nice.
5) She (is / is being) very rude today.

### Answers

1) **think** (opinion)
2) **hear** (perception)
3) **are having** (activity)
4) **smells** (state)
5) **is being** (temporary behaviour)
