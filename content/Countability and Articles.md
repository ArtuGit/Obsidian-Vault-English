Countability affects which article (or no article) you can use.

- **Singular countable** nouns normally need a determiner: **a/an**, **the**, **this**, **my**, **each**, etc.
- **Plural countable** nouns often take **Ø** (no article) for generic meaning.
- **Uncountable** nouns usually take **Ø** for generic meaning, but can take **the** when specific.

British English is the default in this vault. When American usage differs, see “American version”.

## B1/B2 core: the three countability buckets

### 1) Singular countable
✅ Usually: a/an or the (or another determiner)

- ❗ You usually **cannot** say: “I bought chair.”

### 2) Plural countable
- Ø Chairs are expensive. *(generic)*
- The chairs in this room are new. *(specific group)*

### 3) Uncountable
- Ø Furniture is expensive. *(generic)*
- The furniture in this flat is expensive. *(specific)*

## Countable vs uncountable meaning changes
Some nouns can be countable or uncountable depending on meaning.

| Uncountable meaning | Countable meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| food/material (mass) | one animal/object | chicken / a chicken |
| drink (mass) | one glass/cup | coffee / a coffee |
| activity/subject (mass) | one work/piece | paper / a paper |

Examples:
- I ate Ø chicken. *(food)*
- A chicken is in the garden. *(one animal)*
- I’d like a coffee, please. *(one cup; very common)*

## Partitives (useful for uncountables)
If you want “one unit” of an uncountable noun, use a partitive.
- a piece of advice
- a bit of information
- a loaf of bread
- a bottle of water

✅ Correct:

## C1+ Notes

### “Generic” vs “specific” is often more important than countability
Even with uncountables, **the** can appear when you mean a specific context.
- Ø Education is important. *(education in general)*
- The education I received was excellent. *(my specific education)*

### “A coffee” (countable servings)
In cafés, many uncountables become countable to mean a serving.
- a coffee, two waters, three beers

## American version
Core countability rules are the same. Differences show up mostly in institution phrases:
- BrE: in hospital, at university
- AmE: in the hospital, in college
