**Tag questions** are short questions added to the end of a statement. They are commonly used in spoken English to confirm something, express uncertainty, or encourage agreement.

## 🧠 What Is a Tag Question?

A **tag question** turns a **statement** into a **question**. It usually consists of an **auxiliary verb** (or "helping verb") and a **pronoun** that refers to the subject of the sentence.

### General Rule:

|Statement Type|Tag Type|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Positive|Negative tag|She is a teacher, **isn’t she?**|
|Negative|Positive tag|He didn’t come, **did he?**|

## 🔧 Basic Structure

**Statement + auxiliary/modal verb + subject pronoun (tag)?**

> The tag must **match the tense** and **subject** of the main sentence.

## 💡 Tips

- **Intonation matters**:
    
    - **Falling tone** = confirming something you believe is true:  
        _You're a student, aren't you?_ ↓
        
    - **Rising tone** = genuinely asking or unsure:  
        _You're a student, aren't you?_ ↑
