## Common Mistakes

❌ **Wrong**: If I **would have** a car, I would drive.  
✅ **Correct**: If I **had** a car, I would drive.

> Use past simple in the if-clause, not "would."

❌ **Wrong**: If I **was** you, I would go.  
✅ **Correct**: If I **were** you, I would go.

> Use "were" for all subjects (I, he, she, it) in formal English. "Was" is acceptable in informal speech.

❌ **Wrong**: If I had money, I **will** buy it.  
✅ **Correct**: If I had money, I **would** buy it.

> Use "would" (not "will") in the main clause for unreal situations.

## Variations & Notes

### "Were" vs "Was"
In formal English, use "were" for all subjects:

- If I **were** rich... (formal)
- If I **was** rich... (informal, but acceptable in speech)
- If he **were** here... (formal)
- If she **were** taller... (formal)

### Using Other Modals
You can use other modals instead of "would":

- If I had time, I **could** help you. (ability)
- If you asked her, she **might** agree. (possibility)

### Clause Order
The if-clause can come first or second:

- If I were you, I would accept.
- I would accept if I were you.

> Use a comma when the if-clause comes first. No comma when it comes second.
