# Third Conditional

The **Third Conditional** is used to talk about unreal situations in the past—things that didn't happen. It's often used to express regret or imagine different outcomes.

### 2. Expressing Regret
Showing regret about past actions or inactions.

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Wrong**: If I **would have known**, I would have come.  
✅ **Correct**: If I **had known**, I would have come.

> Never use "would have" in the if-clause. Use "had + past participle."

❌ **Wrong**: If she had studied, she **would pass**.  
✅ **Correct**: If she had studied, she **would have passed**.

> Use "would have + past participle" in the main clause for past unreal results.

❌ **Wrong**: If I **had knew** the answer, I would have told you.  
✅ **Correct**: If I **had known** the answer, I would have told you.

> Use the past participle (known), not past simple (knew), after "had."

## Variations & Notes

### Using Other Modals
You can use other modals instead of "would have":

- If I had known, I **could have** helped. (ability)
- If you had asked, she **might have** agreed. (possibility)
- If he had tried, he **should have** succeeded. (expectation)

### Contractions
In spoken English, contractions are common:

- If I**'d** known... (= had known)
- I would**'ve** come... (= would have)
- She wouldn**'t've** been upset... (= would not have)

### Clause Order
The if-clause can come first or second:

- If I had known, I would have called.
- I would have called if I had known.

> Use a comma when the if-clause comes first. No comma when it comes second.
