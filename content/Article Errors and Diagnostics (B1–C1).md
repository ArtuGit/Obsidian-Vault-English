## The 5 most common problems

### 1) Missing a/an with singular count nouns
**Symptom:** You write “I bought phone.”

**Fix:** If the noun is singular countable, add a determiner:
- I bought **a** phone.
- I bought **the** phone you recommended.
- I bought **my** phone online.

Start here: [[Indefinite Article (a-an)]] and [[Countability and Articles]].

---

### 2) Overusing “the” for generic meaning
**Symptom:** “The dogs are loyal.”

**Fix:** Use Ø plural/uncountable for generic:
- Ø Dogs are loyal.
- Ø Music helps me focus.

Start here: [[Zero Article (no article)]] and [[Generic Reference with Articles]].

### 3) Confusing the vs a/an (specific vs not specific)
**Symptom:** “I need the taxi.” (but you mean any taxi)

**Fix:**
- I need **a** taxi. *(any taxi)*
- I need **the** taxi. *(a specific one you and the listener know)*

Start here: [[Definite Article (the)]].

---

### 4) Institution meaning (school/hospital/work)
**Symptom:** “She is in the hospital” (BrE patient meaning)

**Fix (BrE):**
- in Ø hospital (patient)
- in the hospital (in the building / visiting)

Start here: [[Institutions: School, Hospital, Work, Home]].

### 5) Place names (the UK, the Alps, Ø France)
**Symptom:** “the France” / “Ø Alps”

**Fix:** Learn the main categories.
Start here: [[Proper Nouns and Place Names (Articles)]].

## Diagnostic checklist (do this in order)

When you’re unsure, ask:

1) Is it a **proper name**? If yes, check place-name patterns.
2) Is it **singular countable**? If yes, it needs a determiner.
3) Is it **specific/identifiable** to the listener? If yes, consider **the**.
4) Is it **generic** (class/concept)? If yes, prefer Ø plural/uncountable.
5) Is it an **institution phrase** (school/hospital/work/home)?

## C1+ Notes

### Three generic patterns in writing
For academic writing you may need:
- Ø plural (common)
- the + singular (formal concept)
- a/an + singular (typical member)
See [[Generic Reference with Articles]].

### “The” with shared knowledge
Sometimes “the” appears because the reader can infer it (“bridging”):
- I opened a book and read the first chapter.

## American version

- BrE: in hospital
- AmE: in the hospital

Most other diagnostics are the same.
