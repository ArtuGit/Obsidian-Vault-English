Something happening at a particular moment in the future.

- This time tomorrow, I **will be flying** to Paris.

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct | Explanation |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| I will working tomorrow. | I **will be working** tomorrow. | Need *be* |
| She will be work at 9. | She **will be working** at 9. | Need -ing form |
| What you will be doing? | **What will** you **be doing**? | Invert *will* and subject |
| I will be knowing the answer. | I **will know** the answer. | Stative verbs don't take continuous |

## Tense Comparison: Future Continuous vs. Future Simple

| Future Continuous | Future Simple |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Action **in progress** at a future time | Action happening (completed) at a future time |
| Emphasizes **duration/activity** | Emphasizes **fact/completion** |
| More polite for inquiries | More direct |
| "What will you be doing?" | "What will you do?" |

**Examples:**

| Future Continuous | Future Simple |
|-------------------|---------------|
| At 9, I **will be having** breakfast. *(in the middle of eating)* | At 9, I **will have** breakfast. *(will start at 9)* |
| I **will be seeing** him tomorrow. *(it's happening anyway)* | I **will see** him tomorrow. *(decision/plan)* |
| **Will** you **be using** the car? *(polite)* | **Will** you **use** the car? *(more direct)* |

## Future Continuous vs. Present Continuous (for Future)

| Future Continuous | Present Continuous (Future) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| In progress at a future moment | Arranged plans |
| Will be + verb-ing | Am/Is/Are + verb-ing |
| "At 3, I'll be working." | "I'm meeting John at 3." |

**Examples:**
- At 5 PM, I **will be traveling** to the airport. *(action in progress)*
- I**'m traveling** to Paris tomorrow. *(arranged plan)*

## Future Continuous vs. Going to + Verb-ing

Avoid confusion with similar structures:

| Future Continuous | Going to + Verb-ing |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Will be + verb-ing | Going to be + verb-ing |
| I **will be working** at 9. | I **am going to be working** at 9. |
| Standard form | Also correct, but longer |

Both forms are grammatically correct:
- This time tomorrow, I **will be flying** to London.
- This time tomorrow, I **am going to be flying** to London.

## Stative Verbs (Usually No Continuous)

These verbs typically don't use the continuous form—use [[Future Simple]]:

| Category | Use Future Simple |
|----------|-------------------|
| Mental states | I **will know** the answer tomorrow. |
| Emotions | She **will love** the gift. |
| Senses | This **will taste** delicious. |
| Possession | I **will have** more time next week. |

---

## Passive Voice

The Future Continuous Passive describes actions that will be in progress at a specific future time, in passive form. It's **less common** than other passive forms.

### Form

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Positive** | will be being + past participle | The project **will be being reviewed** at that time. |
| **Negative** | will not be being + past participle | The room **won't be being used** then. |
| **Question** | Will + subject + be being + past participle? | **Will** the documents **be being processed**? |

### Examples

**Actions in progress at a future time:**
- At 3 PM tomorrow, the presentation **will be being given**.
- This time next week, the building **will be being inspected**.
- While we wait, the data **will be being analyzed**.

### Usage Note

⚠️ **The Future Continuous Passive is grammatically correct but uncommon.** The structure "will be being" can sound awkward. Native speakers often prefer alternatives:

| Awkward | More Natural |
|---------|--------------|
| The report **will be being written** at 3 PM. | The report **will be** in progress at 3 PM. |
| The house **will be being painted** tomorrow. | They **will be painting** the house tomorrow. *(active)* |
| The issue **will be being discussed**. | The issue **will be under discussion**. |

**Recommendation:** Use when necessary for emphasis, but consider active voice or simpler constructions.
