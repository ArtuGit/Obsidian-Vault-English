Demonstratives are words we use to **point to** people/things and show whether they feel **near or far** (in space, time, or in the conversation).

They are common in [[Parts of Speech]] as both **determiners** (before a noun) and **pronouns** (standing alone).

> [!NOTE]
> The core demonstratives are: **this, that, these, those**.

### Core forms

| Distance | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Near (close to the speaker / “now”) | this | these |
| Far (far from the speaker / “then”) | that | those |

**Examples**
- **This** book is mine. (near)
- **That** book over there is yours. (far)
- **These** shoes are new. (plural, near)
- **Those** houses are beautiful. (plural, far)

### Demonstratives as determiners vs pronouns

**Determiner** = demonstrative + noun
- **This** idea is interesting.
- I don’t like **those** rules.

**Pronoun** = demonstrative alone (replaces a noun)
- **This** is interesting.
- I don’t like **those**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Agreement matters: **this/that** + singular, **these/those** + plural.

### “Near” and “far” meanings (not only physical)

**1) Physical distance**
- Could you pass me **that** plate? (farther away)
- Look at **these** pictures here. (close)

**2) Time**
- **This** morning / **this** week / **these** days (around now)
- **That** day / **that** year / **those** days (more distant past)

**3) Psychological distance (attitude)**
- I don’t like **that** idea. (sounds detached/critical)
- I love **this** plan. (sounds engaged/close)

**4) Discourse (in speaking/writing)**
- **This** is what I mean: practice every day. (introducing what comes next)
- The exam was difficult. **That** was the main problem. (referring back)

> [!TIP]
> In writing, **this** often points forward (what you’re about to say) and **that** often points backward (what you just said), but real usage can vary.

### Common fixed phrases

- **this/that + noun**: this question, that reason
- **this/that + be**: This is my friend. / That’s correct.
- **like this/that**: Do it like this.
- **this/that one**, **these/those ones**: I’ll take this one.
- **such** (demonstrative-like): I’ve never seen **such** a thing.

### Common mistakes

**1) Singular/plural mismatch**
- Incorrect: *These book is good.*
- Correct: **This** book is good. / **These** books are good.

**2) Using a demonstrative pronoun but needing a noun**
- Confusing: *I don’t like those people’s behavior; those is rude.*
- Better: I don’t like those people’s behavior; **it** is rude. (see [[Personal Pronouns]])

**3) “That’s why” vs “This is why”**
- **That’s why** is very common to explain a reason after something mentioned.
- **This is why** often introduces an explanation you’re about to give.

**4) “This kind of…” agreement**
- Common: **this kind of** thing (singular)
- Plural: **these kinds of** things

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid: *these kind of things* (mixing plural **these** with singular **kind**).

### Quick practice

Choose the best option:
1) _____ is my favorite song. (playing right now) → **This / That**
2) Do you remember _____ summer in 2020? → **this / that**
3) I like _____ shoes here. (in your hand) → **these / those**
4) The rules were unclear. _____ caused problems. → **This / That**
