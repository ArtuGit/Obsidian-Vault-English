Generic reference means talking about a **whole class** or a concept (not a specific individual).

English has three common generic patterns:
1) **Ø + plural**: Ø Dogs are loyal.
2) **Ø + uncountable**: Ø Water is essential.
3) **a/an + singular** (less common, often “any typical member”): A dog needs exercise.
Sometimes **the + singular** is also generic (more formal/academic): The tiger is an endangered species.

British English is the default in this vault. When American usage differs, see “American version”.

## B1/B2 core: the most useful generic patterns

### 1) Plural generic (Ø)
- Ø Dogs are loyal.
- Ø Smartphones are expensive.

### 2) Uncountable generic (Ø)
- Ø Coffee contains caffeine.
- Ø Information travels fast.

These two cover most everyday generic sentences.

---

## a/an generic (singular)
Use **a/an + singular** when you mean “a typical example” of the class.

- A dog needs daily exercise. *(any typical dog)*
- A teacher should be patient.

This often feels like “any”:
- A good friend helps you. ≈ Any good friend helps you.

---

## the generic (singular)
Use **the + singular** to speak about a class as a concept (often academic/formal).

- The tiger is an endangered species.
- The bicycle changed transport.

In everyday speech, many learners can avoid this and use plural generic instead:
- Tigers are endangered.
