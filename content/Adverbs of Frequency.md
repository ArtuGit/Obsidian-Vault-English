**Adverbs of frequency** tell us **how often** an action occurs. They describe **habitual actions**, **routines**, or **repeated events**, and answer the question **"How often?"**

## Types of Adverbs of Frequency

Adverbs of frequency fall into two main categories:

### 1. **Definite Frequency**

These specify an **exact frequency** of an action.

**Examples:**

- **Once** (once a week)
    
- **Twice** (twice a day)
    
- **Three times** (three times a month)
    
- **Every day/week/year**
    
- **Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Annually**
    

**Sentences:**

- She visits her grandmother **once a week**.
    
- He goes jogging **every morning**.
    

### 2. **Indefinite Frequency**

These do **not give an exact number**, but show **general frequency**.

**Common indefinite adverbs of frequency (from most to least frequent):**

| Adverb           | Approximate Frequency |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| **Always**       | 100% of the time      |
| **Usually**      | 80–90%                |
| **Often**        | 60–70%                |
| **Sometimes**    | 40–50%                |
| **Occasionally** | 30%                   |
| **Seldom**       | 10–20%                |
| **Rarely**       | 5–10%                 |
| **Hardly ever**  | Less than 5%          |
| **Never**        | 0%                    |

**Sentences:**

- I **always** drink coffee in the morning.
    
- She **often** goes hiking on weekends.
    
- They **rarely** eat out.
    
- He **never** smokes.

## Position in Sentences

### With **simple verbs** (e.g., _eat, play, read_):

Place the adverb **before** the main verb.

- She **usually** eats breakfast at 7.
    
- They **never** watch TV in the morning.
    

### With the verb **to be**:

Place the adverb **after** the verb.

- He is **always** late.
    
- We are **sometimes** tired after work.
    

### With **auxiliary verbs** (e.g., _have, will, can_):

Place the adverb **after the first auxiliary**.

- She has **never** been to Paris.
    
- You will **often** find him at the gym.

### Summary

**Adverbs of frequency** describe **how often** something happens. They can be **definite** (like _twice a week_) or **indefinite** (like _usually_, _rarely_). Proper placement depends on the type of verb used in the sentence.
