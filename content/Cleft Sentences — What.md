What-clefts (also called **pseudo-clefts**) are a way to **put focus on information** by using a *what*-clause.

They’re especially useful when you want to emphasize:

- the **action/thing you did**
- the **main point** (a summary)
- a **correction** or **contrast**

---

## Core idea

Instead of saying a “normal” sentence, you split it into:

- a **what-clause** (the background / set-up)
- a **focus** after *be* (the highlighted part)

> [!NOTE]
> What-clefts often sound natural in spoken English because they help speakers **organize information**.

---

## Main patterns

### 1) Standard what-cleft

**What + clause + be + FOCUS**

Examples:

- What I **need** is **a break**.
- What she **said** was **a lie**.
- What we **did** was **apologize**.
- What I **like** about it is **the ending**.

> [!TIP]
> What-clefts are great for focusing the **verb/action**:
> - Normal: I apologized.
> - Cleft: What I did was **apologize**.
> This is one reason they complement [[Cleft Sentences — It]].

---

### 2) Reversed pseudo-cleft

**FOCUS + be + what + clause**

Examples:

- **A break** is what I need.
- **Apologize** is what we did.
- **The ending** is what I like.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reversed pseudo-clefts are often **stronger / more dramatic**. Use them when you really want emphasis.

---

### 3) “All / The thing” variants (common in speech)

Sometimes English avoids *what* and uses **all** or **the thing**:

- All I want is **peace and quiet**.
- The thing I don’t understand is **why he lied**.

---

## What can be the focus?

The focus can be many forms:

- **noun phrase**: *What I need is **a new laptop**.*
- **to-infinitive**: *What I want is **to leave early**.*
- **bare infinitive** (often after *do*): *What I did was **call her**.*
- **-ing form** (sometimes): *What I hate is **waiting**.*
- **clause**: *What matters is **that you tried**.*

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid clunky overuse. If there’s no real contrast/focus, a normal sentence is clearer.

---

## Meaning and typical uses

### 1) Highlighting the main point

- What matters is **your progress**, not perfection.

### 2) Explaining / clarifying

- What I mean is **that we should start earlier**.

### 3) Correction or contrast

- What I said was **“fifteen”**, not “fifty”.
- What I need is **advice**, not sympathy.

This interacts with information structure and [[Word Order]].

## Grammar notes (agreement and tense)

- The *be* verb matches the focus phrase in **tense**:
	- What I needed **was** a break.
	- What I need **is** a break.

- Singular vs plural:
	- What I need **is** some help. *(help = uncountable)*
	- What I need **are** two volunteers. *(plural focus, more formal)*

> [!NOTE]
> In everyday speech, many speakers still use **is** even with plural focus (*What I need is two volunteers*). In careful writing, prefer **are**.

---

## Common learner mistakes

> [!CAUTION]
> 1) **Wrong focus type**
> - If you want to focus a person/time/place, an it-cleft is usually better: see [[Cleft Sentences — It]].
>
> 2) **Awkward verb choice**
> - Prefer natural verbs in the what-clause (*need / want / mean / do / like / hate*).
>
> 3) **Overusing “What I want to say is …”**
> - It’s fine, but can sound repetitive. Alternatives: *The point is … / What I mean is …*

---

## Practice (rewrite with a what-cleft)

Rewrite each sentence so the **bold** part becomes the focus.

1) I **need a break**.
2) We **apologized**.
3) I **mean that we should start earlier**.
4) I **like the ending**.
5) I **want peace and quiet**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer key (possible answers)**
> 1) What I need is **a break**.
> 2) What we did was **apologize**.
> 3) What I mean is **that we should start earlier**.
> 4) What I like is **the ending**. / What I like about it is **the ending**.
> 5) All I want is **peace and quiet**. / What I want is **peace and quiet**.
