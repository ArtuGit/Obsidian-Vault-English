# Mixed Conditionals

**Mixed Conditionals** combine elements from different conditional types. They are used when the time in the if-clause is different from the time in the main clause.

## Structure

There are two main types of Mixed Conditionals:

### Type 1: Past Condition → Present Result

| Clause | Form |
|--------|------|
| If clause | If + past perfect (had + past participle) |
| Main clause | would + base verb |

**Example**: If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now.

### Type 2: Present Condition → Past Result

| Clause | Form |
|--------|------|
| If clause | If + past simple |
| Main clause | would have + past participle |

**Example**: If I were braver, I would have asked her out.

---

## Type 1: Past Condition → Present Result

A past action (or inaction) affects the present situation.

### When to Use
- The condition happened (or didn't happen) in the past
- The result is about now or a general present state

### Examples

| If clause (past) | Main clause (present) |
|------------------|----------------------|
| If I had accepted that job, | I would be living in Paris now. |
| If she hadn't missed her flight, | she would be here with us. |
| If I had learned to code, | I would have a better job. |
| If he had saved money, | he wouldn't be broke now. |
| If we had left earlier, | we wouldn't be stuck in traffic. |

### More Examples in Context

- **If I had studied harder at school**, I **would have** a better job now.
  > (I didn't study → Now I don't have a good job)

- **If she had married him**, she **would be** unhappy now.
  > (She didn't marry him → Now she's not unhappy)

- **If I hadn't eaten so much**, I **wouldn't feel** sick now.
  > (I ate too much → Now I feel sick)

---

## Type 2: Present Condition → Past Result

A present state or characteristic affected a past situation.

### When to Use
- The condition is about a general truth or permanent state (now)
- The result is about a specific past event

### Examples

| If clause (present) | Main clause (past) |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| If I were taller, | I would have played basketball. |
| If she weren't so shy, | she would have spoken up. |
| If I spoke French, | I would have understood them. |
| If he were more careful, | he wouldn't have made that mistake. |
| If I weren't afraid of flying, | I would have traveled more. |

### More Examples in Context

- **If I were you**, I **would have apologized**.
  > (I'm not you [general] → You should have apologized [past])

- **If she weren't so stubborn**, she **would have accepted** help.
  > (She is stubborn [now/always] → She didn't accept help [past])

- **If I knew how to swim**, I **would have joined** them at the beach.
  > (I don't know how to swim [now] → I didn't join them [past])

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Wrong**: If I **would have studied**, I would be successful now.  
✅ **Correct**: If I **had studied**, I would be successful now.

> Never use "would have" in the if-clause.

❌ **Wrong**: If I **was** you, I would have helped.  
✅ **Correct**: If I **were** you, I would have helped.

> Use "were" for hypothetical present conditions (formal).

❌ **Wrong**: If she had called me, I **would helped** her.  
✅ **Correct**: If she had called me, I **would have helped** her.

> Don't forget "have" in "would have + past participle."

## How to Choose the Right Mixed Conditional

Ask yourself:

1. **When is the condition?** (Past or Present)
2. **When is the result?** (Past or Present)

| Condition Time | Result Time | Structure |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Past | Present | If + past perfect, would + base verb |
| Present | Past | If + past simple, would have + past participle |

---

## Comparison with Other Conditionals

| Type | If clause | Main clause | Example |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Second | past simple | would + base | If I had money, I would buy it. |
| Third | past perfect | would have + pp | If I had had money, I would have bought it. |
| Mixed (Past→Present) | past perfect | would + base | If I had saved money, I would be rich now. |
| Mixed (Present→Past) | past simple | would have + pp | If I were rich, I would have bought it. |

## Variations & Notes

### Using Other Modals
You can use other modals in the main clause:

- If I had studied law, I **could be** a lawyer now. (ability)
- If she weren't sick, she **might have come** to the party. (possibility)

### Clause Order
The if-clause can come first or second:

- If I had taken that job, I would be in London now.
- I would be in London now if I had taken that job.

> Use a comma when the if-clause comes first. No comma when it comes second.
