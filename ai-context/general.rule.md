# Project Overview

## Goal
Obsidian Valet is designed to help with learning and referencing English language topics.

## Notes (Articles)
- Keep article titles concise; avoid duplicating H1 with the Obsidian/system title.
- Start with foundational ideas before adding advanced notes.
- Use Obsidian-style wikilinks `[[note-name]]` to connect related topics.
- Try to find and add cross-link to a created article

## Markdown
Use such markdown elements as 
-	>[!NOTE]
-	>[!TIP]
-	>[!IMPORTANT]
-	>[!WARNING]
-	>[!CAUTION]
